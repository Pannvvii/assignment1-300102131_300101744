# Your solution to E26

Provide a table of what you think will be the advantages and
disadvantages of designs 2, 3, 4 and 5.


| Design | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design 2 | Since Design 2 only stores the polar coordinates, the system will use less storage and time when computing with polar coordinates | This design computes the cartesian coordinates, meaning it will have to recompute these several times if cartesian coordinates are used frequently |
| Design 3 | Since Design 3 only stores cartesian coordinates, the system uses less time and storage when working with cartesian coordinates | this design computes polar coordinates, meaning if they are used frequently it will have to recompute these values several times |
| Design 4 | Both polar and cartesian points are stored and allow for easy access in the long run if both values are used often | Double the memory will be used for instance variables and makes this method inefficent if only used for short-term computations |
| Design 5 | Abstract class allows for the creation of several designs and common base functionality of subclasses | any errors that may be apparent in the abstract class can create problems within the subclasses |
